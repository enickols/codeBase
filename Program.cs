**An interface is like a contract. In the human world, the contract between the two or more 
**humans binds them to act as per the contract. In the same way, the interface includes the 
**declaration of one or more functionalities. Entities that implement the interface must define 
**functionalities declared in the interface. In C#, a class or a struct can implement one or more interfaces.

**In C#, an interface can be defined using the interface keyword. Interfaces can contain methods, 
**properties, indexers, and events as members.

**Consider the following IPen interface that declares some basic functionality for a pen.
